# focus-room
Focus Room is a virtual co-working app that lets people join pomodoro-style focus rooms

## Why I Built This
As a chronic procrastinator and computer science student, I wanted a tool that would:
- Be dead-simple to use
- Give me a sense of “presence” without pressure
- Help me focus for short bursts with others
  
## Live Demo
[focusloop.vercel.app](https://focusloop.vercel.app) *(Coming soon)*

## Intended Features
- Join or create a shared focus room
- Real-time synced Pomodoro timer (25/5 min)
- Post-session reflection
- Firebase-powered backend (Realtime DB + Auth)
- Google Sign-In for personal tracking
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
